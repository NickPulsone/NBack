# NBack
Implements the psychological N-Back task. The N-Back task (usually either 1-back or 2-back) involves a sequence of visual stimuli in the form of letters. The user is instructed to speak if the letter presented on the screen was there N iterations ago.

"run_nback.py" will run the test on a subject and save an audio file and csv file with the relevant data. "process_nback.py" will use this data to calculate reaction times, accuracies, etc. Post processing is mostly automatic, but does require review from a user to doule check the responses.
